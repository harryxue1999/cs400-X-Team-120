# X-Team 120 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Talk about our skills and what we are able to and enjoy doing. If someone is unable to do a task we talk and if someone is able to do it better, we will swap, if not we will work together to find a solution to the problem. 


## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Set a few deadlines and benchmarks and check up with each other's progress on those days. 


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Use github to comment on our code and each other's code when we have problems, so others can look at it and try to come up with a solution.
If the problem is really complex, we will try to meet up in person. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Check on previously set benchmarks using github. Organize benchmarks so that no one person has too much to do consecutively,
if someone is really falling behind they can postpone it to the next benchmark date, or ask someone to help if they can. 


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Be respectful of each other, be humble and supportive!
